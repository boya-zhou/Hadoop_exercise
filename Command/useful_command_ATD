Compiling your own Java code
   ---------------------
	- First create your java file (Example WordCount.java is found under "Documents" folder)
        - Go to the directory containing your code (E.g., "D    
	> mkdir wordcount_classes
	> javac -classpath /usr/share/hadoop/hadoop-core-1.2.1.jar -d wordcount_classes ./WordCount.java
	> jar -cvf ./wordcount.jar -C wordcount_classes/ .

	- Now a jar file is created and you are ready to submit a job as follows:
	- Notice that "org.apache.hadoop.examples" in the command is the package name you defined in your code.
	> hadoop jar ./wordcount.jar org.apache.hadoop.examples.WordCount <path to input file in HDFS> <path to outout file in HDFS>
